Description: tfhunter is used to identify plant transcription factors (TFs) 
    from protein sequence data and classify them into families and subfamilies
    using the classification scheme implemented in PlantTFDB.
    TFs are identified and classified using profile hidden Markov models
    for known TF families available on the PFAM database and using pre-built
    .hmm files that come with this package.
