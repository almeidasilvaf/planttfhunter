The goal of __planttfhunter__ is to identify plant transcription factors from protein 
sequence data and classify them into families and subfamilies using the
classification scheme implemented 
in [PlantTFDB](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz1020).

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). 
Then install __planttfhunter__ from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) 
using the following code:

```{r 'install', eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("planttfhunter")
```

And the development version from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/almeidasilvaf/planttfhunter) with:

```{r 'install_dev', eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("almeidasilvaf/planttfhunter")
```

## Citation

Below is the citation output from using `citation('planttfhunter')` in R. Please
run this yourself to check for any updates on how to cite __planttfhunter__.

```{r 'citation', eval = requireNamespace('planttfhunter')}
print(citation('planttfhunter'), bibtex = TRUE)
```

Please note that the __planttfhunter__ project was only made possible thanks to many 
other R and bioinformatics software authors, which are cited either in the 
vignettes and/or the paper(s) describing this package.
